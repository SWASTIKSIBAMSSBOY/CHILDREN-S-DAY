        <h2>SOMETHING MORE ABOUT HIS LIFE.</h2>
        <b>Nehru described his childhood as a "sheltered and uneventful one". He grew up in an atmosphere of privilege at wealthy homes, including a palatial estate called the Anand Bhavan. His father had him educated at home by private governesses and tutors.[12] Influenced by the Irish theosophist Ferdinand T. Brooks' teaching,[13] Nehru became interested in science and theosophy.[14] A family friend, Annie Besant subsequently initiated him into the Theosophical Society at age thirteen. However, his interest in theosophy did not prove to be enduring, and he left the society shortly after Brooks departed as his tutor.[15] He wrote: "for nearly three years [Brooks] was with me and in many ways, he influenced me greatly".[14]</b>
        <b>Nehru became an ardent nationalist during his youth.[17] The Second Boer War and the Russo-Japanese War intensified his feelings. Of the latter he wrote, "[The] Japanese victories [had] stirred up my enthusiasm. ...Nationalistic ideas filled my mind. ... I mused of Indian freedom and Asiatic freedom from the thraldom of Europe."[14] Later, in 1905, when he had begun his institutional schooling at Harrow, a leading school in England where he was nicknamed "Joe",[18] G. M. Trevelyan's Garibaldi books, which he had received as prizes for academic merit, influenced him greatly.[19] He viewed Garibaldi as a revolutionary hero. He wrote: "Visions of similar deeds in India came before, of [my] gallant fight for [Indian] freedom and in my mind, India and Italy got strangely mixed together.</b>
        <b>Nehru's theosophical interests had induced him to the study of the Buddhist and Hindu scriptures.[16] According to B. R. Nanda, these scriptures were Nehru's "first introduction to the religious and cultural heritage of [India]. ...[They] provided Nehru the initial impulse for [his] long intellectual quest which culminated…in The Discovery of India."[16]</b>
